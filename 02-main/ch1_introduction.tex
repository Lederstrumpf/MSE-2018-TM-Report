\section{Context}

The Ethereum blockchain aims to move from the current Proof of Work (\gls{pow})
consensus protocol to a Proof of Stake (\gls{pos}). Multiple teams are
currently researching ways to describe and implement such a protocol. One of
these teams, lead by Vlad Zamfir, is working on a protocol family called
\gls{cbc} Casper.  \gls{cbc} Casper describes an abstract set of protocols that
can achieve consensus between nodes on any kind of value, for example an integer, a vote,
or a blockchain. This project aims to find and compare block publishing
strategies for a \gls{cbc} Casper blockchain consensus.

\section{Objectives}
As the \gls{cbc} Casper paper only describes an abstract way of constructing
\gls{pos} consensus protocols and does not make any assumptions on synchrony,
one of the main challenges of the actual implementation is to find incentive
mechanisms and strategies telling the nodes when to produce blocks.  The main
goals of this project are:

\begin{itemize}
        \item to propose multiple block producing strategies;
        \item to create a model that allows one to easily compare said strategies;
        \item to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy.
\end{itemize}
